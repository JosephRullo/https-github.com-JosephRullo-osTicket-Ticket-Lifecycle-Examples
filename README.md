<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<h2>Step 1.</h2> 

**User Sign In**
<p>
Let's begin with signing in as one of the users that was created in the previous installation and configuration of osTicket. In this example the user will go to http://localhost/osTicket/ and click on "Sign in" in the upper right corner. Now enter in the Username and Password that was assigned to them and click "Sign In".

<h2>Step 2.</h2> 

**Create New Ticket**
<p>
After signing in as a User, go to the "Open New Ticket" tab at the top of the screen. Now choose a "Help Topic" that best fits the issue that is occuring -> Next type in an "Issue Summary" of the problem. -> below that enter in a more detailed description of what's going on so that the Agents have a good idea of what's going on and how to resolve it. -> click "Create Ticket" to submit it.
